        "\n",
        "1. Implement neural networks for **regression** and **classification** tasks using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.  \n",
        "2. Apply **hyperparameter optimization** (e.g., Random Search, Grid Search, or KerasTuner) to systematically improve model performance.  \n",
        "3. Select and justify appropriate **activation functions**, **architectures**, and **training configurations** for different machine learning problems.  \n",

        "- You will use an environmental dataset to predict **USDA county-level crop yields**.  \n",
        "- In *Assignment 3*, you trained tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest and XGBoost).  \n",
        "- Here, you will extend that work by building a **neural network regressor**, capable of modeling complex, nonlinear relationships between climate variables and crop productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Part 2 — Classification Task: Recognizing Handwritten Digits**\n",
        "- You will explore the **MNIST dataset**, which contains images of handwritten digits (0–9).  \n",
        "- This section demonstrates how neural networks perform **image recognition** and **multi-class classification** using **softmax activation** for probabilistic prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why Learn Both Tasks?**\n",
        "- **Regression** shows how neural networks predict **continuous outcomes** (e.g., yield).  \n",
        "- **Classification** illustrates how they categorize **discrete classes** (e.g., digits).  \n",
        "Mastering both prepares you to design neural architectures suited to a wide range of real-world applications — from climate-based yield forecasting to computer vision.\n",

        "\n",
        "  1. **Evaluate model performance:**  \n",
        "     - Use the test dataset (`X_test_flat`, `y_test`) to compute the final **accuracy** and **loss**.  \n",
        "     - These metrics show how well the tuned model generalizes beyond the training data.\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. **Generate predictions:**  \n",
        "     - The model outputs **class probabilities** (confidence scores for each digit) when calling `predict()`.  \n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       pred_probs = best_model.predict(X_test_flat[:15])\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "       Each row in `pred_probs` is a vector of 10 values (for digits 0–9) representing how confident the model is in each class.  \n",

        "       ```python\n",
        "       pred_labels = np.argmax(pred_probs, axis=1)\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "       This picks the index (0–9) of the **maximum probability** in each row — giving the final **predicted digit label**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. **Visualize results:**  \n",
        "     - Display a few test images with their **True (T)** and **Predicted (P)** labels.  \n",
        "     - Use color cues to make results clear:  \n",
        "       - 🟩 **Green title:** correct prediction.  \n",
        "       - 🟥 **Red title:** incorrect prediction.  \n",
